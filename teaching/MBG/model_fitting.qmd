## Overview

- Exploring relationships
- Exploring overdispersion
- Exploring spatial correlation

## Exploring relationships

- How to explore relationships with count data? 
- How to deal with binary data?
- How to model non-linear relationships?

## Overdispersion in Count Data {.smaller}

- **What is overdispersion?**
  - Occurs when the variance of count data exceeds the mean.
  - Violates the Poisson assumption:  
    $$ \text{Var}(Y) = \mathbb{E}(Y). $$

- **Why does it matter?**
  - Standard models (e.g., Poisson regression) underestimate uncertainty.
  - Leads to overly optimistic confidence intervals and p-values.

---

## Example: Overdispersion in Correlated Binary Data {.smaller}

- Consider $Y = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$, where $X_i$ are correlated binary variables.

. . .

- If $X_i$ are independent, $Y$ follows a Binomial distribution: 
  $$ \mathbb{E}(Y) = np, \quad \text{Var}(Y) = np(1-p). $$
  
. . .

- If $X_i$ are correlated, the variance increases:  
  $$ \text{Var}(Y) = np(1-p) + \sum_{i \neq j} \text{Cov}(X_i, X_j). $$
  
. . .

- This leads to overdispersion.

---

## Example: Negative Binomial Distribution {.smaller .scrollable}

- A common solution for overdispersed count data.
- Extends the Poisson distribution by introducing a dispersion parameter $\alpha$:  
  $$ \mathbb{E}(Y) = \mu, \quad \text{Var}(Y) = \mu + \alpha \mu^2. $$
- When $\alpha = 0$, it reduces to Poisson.

- **Random Effects Interpretation**:
  - The Negative Binomial can be interpreted as a Gamma-Poisson mixture.
  - The Poisson mean $\mu$ is drawn from a Gamma distribution, introducing extra variability.

## Random Effects Models for Overdispersion {.smaller .scrollable}

- Overdispersion often arises due to **unobserved heterogeneity**.
- A solution is to introduce **random effects** that account for latent variability.

. . .

- **Random Intercept Model**:  
  $$ Y_{ij} \mid b_j \sim \text{Poisson}(\mu_{ij}), \quad \log(\mu_{ij}) = X_{ij} \beta + b_j. $$
  
. . .

  - $b_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ captures between-group variability.

. . .

  - Leads to extra variability in counts, addressing overdispersion.

. . .

- **Connection to Negative Binomial**:
  - If $b_j$ follows a **Gamma** distribution instead of Normal, the model is equivalent to a **Negative Binomial**.

---

## Marginal Models for Overdispersion {.smaller .scrollable}

- An alternative to random effects models is using **marginal models**.
- Instead of modeling subject-level variation, these models estimate **population-averaged effects**.

- **Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)**:
  - Does not assume a specific distribution for random effects.
  - Uses a working correlation matrix to account for within-group dependence.
  - Robust standard errors help correct for overdispersion.

**Example 1**

-  A clinical trial measuring **blood pressure** at multiple time points for patients in different hospitals.  
- **Why Use Random Effects?**  
  - Each patient has their own **baseline blood pressure** that varies.  
  - A **random intercept** accounts for individual differences.  
  - If hospitals have different treatment protocols, a **random hospital effect** can be included.  

. . .

**Example 2**

- **Study Design**: A population-wide study on whether a new **influenza vaccine** reduces hospitalization rates.  
- **Why Use Marginal Models?**  
  - Interest is in the **population-averaged effect** of the vaccine, not individual variation.  
  - **Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)** account for correlation in repeated measures without assuming a specific random effect structure.
