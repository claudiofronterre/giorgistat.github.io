## Overview of topics

-   How to assess residual spatial correlation
-   How to formulate and fit a geostatistical model
-   How to interpret the results from a model fit

## Which residuals should we use to assess spatial correlation? {.smaller}


- **Pearson Residuals**: $$\frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(\hat{y}_i)}}$$

- **Deviance Residuals**: $$\text{sign}(y_i - \hat{y}_i) \times \sqrt{d_i}$$
where $d_i$ is the deviance contribution of observation $i$.

- **Random Effects Residuals**: $\hat{Z}_i$, i.e. the estimated random effect for each location/household/cluster/village.

## The Empirical Variogram using Random Effects Residuals {.smaller}


- The empirical variogram is defined as:
$$
  \gamma(D_{[a,b]}) = \frac{1}{2|D_{[a,b]}|} \sum_{(i,j) \in D_{[a,b]}} (\hat{Z}_i - \hat{Z}_j)^2
$$
  where:
  - $D_{[a,b]}$ is a class of distance with lower limit $a$ and upper limit $b$;
  - $|D_{[a,b]}|$ is the number of pairs of observations whose locations ar at a distance between $a$ and $b$.
